# Welcome to the autonet <h1>
Behold this fictional network put together to support training and development of network automation technologies. Its pretty bare bones to start with. Each router has a default configuraiton with one managment IP address connected via an out of band managment network to the NMS stations. SSH is configured in order to support connection from automation tools.
